### Patch

- Make inline docs and readme readable.

## 0.1.0 - [2022-06-26]

This is the initial release of the `comment_templates` module.

### âœ¨ Features

- Replace comment tags in markdown and JavaScript files.
- Pipe values through pipe functions to transform the variable.
- Extract comment tag values from files. This allows using a markdown file to populate the comments in a corresponding TypeScript file.

There is potential in this idea, but I think it might be best served as a **vscode** extension.
