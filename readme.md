# comment_templates

> Update markdown, TypeScript, and JavaScript files in place using comments as template tags.

## Why?

Often, while developing a project, you will want to automatically update sections of content in the file. For example:

- The `version` has been updated and should be reflected in multiple files.
- The API has changed and the autogenerated documentation needs to be updated in the `readme.md` file.

The solution is to wrap the content you want to replace in a language specific comment block. A build command is then run which injects values into the comment tag while preserving the tags. This means that blocks can be updated multiple times with new data.

## API

<!-- ={apiDocs} -->Docs go here<!-- ={/apiDocs}-->

<code>this is <a>code</a></code>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-ts">
<pre>
const <a>a</a> = b;
</pre>
</div>

```ts
commentTemplate("hello");
throw new Error("wassup");
```
